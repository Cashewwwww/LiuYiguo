            <h3>Arduino IDE
                The Arduino IDE is an open-source integrated development environment for writing and uploading code to Arduino microcontroller boards. It provides an easy-to-use programming environment that allows you to write code for controlling and operating hardware. The Arduino programming language is based on the Processing language and is inspired by the Wiring framework, both of which are programming languages designed for artists and hobbyists.
